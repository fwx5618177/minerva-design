# IconCanvas

Many icons on one canvas, drawn by WebGPU, WebGL2 or WebGL in a few instanced draws, or by Canvas2D: dense pictures, maps, particles and animations of thousands of icons.

## Documentation

### How it draws

IconCanvas places icons by position, size, rotation, color and opacity in CSS pixels, and draws them all on one canvas with the best backend available (WebGPU -> WebGL2 -> WebGL -> Canvas2D).

Geometry: each icon is flattened within a quarter of a device pixel and its stroke turned into triangles (a quad per segment, round fans for joins and caps), once per icon, stroke width and level of detail.

Batching: all meshes live in one vertex buffer and every icon is an instance (position, size, rotation, color); consecutive identical icons are one instanced draw call.

Quality: 4× MSAA smooths the edges, and a per-icon depth test draws each pixel of an icon once, so translucent icons blend exactly like the SVG stroke.

Robustness: auto skips software GPUs, a lost GPU context restarts the backend (a backend lost twice is skipped), and the canvas root reports the backend in data-renderer.

For icons in the interface, use Icon: SVG is lighter, accessible and server-rendered. Use IconCanvas when the icons are the picture.

## IconCanvas

Support: n/a

Web icon component (inline SVG or a WebGPU / WebGL / Canvas2D canvas): no native counterpart yet; draw the same icon data of minerva-design/icons/core (iconPathData, toSvg, toSvgDataUri, toSvgBase64DataUri) with the platform's SVG or image support.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
