# Charts

GPU-accelerated charts (WebGPU, WebGL2 or WebGL, with a Canvas2D fallback) that stay at 60 fps with millions of points: trends, comparisons, statistics, parts of a whole, hierarchies and flows, networks, dependencies and trees, finance and trading, and 3D. Chart mixes line, area, bar, scatter, candlestick and heatmap series; every other component is a preset for one chart type. Start with the galleries below: a live thumbnail of every chart type, each linking to its page.

Type references resolve through the [type graph](/minerva-design/reference/1.20.3/types.json) or getType() from minerva-design/contracts.

## Documentation

#### How it renders

The data layer is drawn with WebGPU, falling back to WebGL2, WebGL, then Canvas2D (renderer="auto"); the root element gets data-renderer once ready. A chart stacks four layers:

Canvas2D background: grid, axes and annotation areas

GPU data layer: lines, areas, bars and dots

Canvas2D overlay: tick labels, point labels, highlight

DOM: tooltip and legend (selectable, accessible text)

#### Large data

Pass large series as columns of typed arrays ({ x: Float64Array, y: Float64Array }): no per-point objects are created. When x is sorted, hit testing is a binary search and only the visible range is drawn, so a 1M-point line or scatter stays at 60 fps on WebGPU, WebGL2 and WebGL.

#### Interaction and keyboard

Ctrl / ⌘ + wheel or a trackpad pinch zooms (a plain wheel scrolls the page), drag pans when zoomed and double-click resets.

Focus the chart: ← / → move the highlighted point (announced to screen readers), + / - zoom, 0 resets and Esc clears.

#### Theming and the engine

Colors come from the Minerva CSS variables: --chart-series-1..8 when defined, else the theme colors (--primary-color, --success-color...). Theme switches are picked up automatically.

minerva-design/charts/core is the same engine without React: createChart(container, options) works in any framework.

#### Chart families

Every chart type is shown below as a live thumbnail, grouped in six galleries; each caption links to the page of the chart:

Basic 2D: line, area, range area, bar, horizontal bar, combination / dual axis, scatter, bubble charts and sparklines.

Statistics, KPIs and planning: histogram, box plot, waterfall, heatmap, calendar heatmap, gauge, bullet, radial bar and Gantt charts.

Parts of a whole, hierarchies and flows: pie and donut, radar, funnel, quadrant, treemap, sunburst and Sankey charts.

Relationships and hierarchies: network graphs (force, circular and arc layouts, GPU-drawn up to tens of thousands of nodes), dependency graphs (layered DAGs with the critical path), trees (tidy and radial trees, mind maps, org charts) and chord diagrams.

Finance and trading: candlesticks, the trading chart (volume profile, drawing tools, bar replay, synchronized charts and order entry) with 21 built-in technical indicators (MA / EMA / WMA, Bollinger, VWAP, volume, MACD, RSI, KDJ, ATR, Parabolic SAR, Ichimoku, SuperTrend, Keltner, Donchian, OBV, CCI, Stochastic RSI, DMI, Williams %R, MFI), the depth chart, order book, order book heatmap and time & sales.

3D: 3D scatter and 3D line (glowing, additively blended point clouds included), 3D surface and 3D bar charts.

The thumbnails are mounted only while they are near the viewport (IntersectionObserver): the page stays fast and never holds more GPU contexts than the browser allows. The order book widgets stream a simulated market and pause off screen.

The GPU charts pick their backend in four tiers, WebGPU → WebGL2 → WebGL → Canvas2D, so they render in every browser and survive a GPU loss. setDefaultChartRenderer() changes the default backend of every chart at once: the renderer selector pinned on the chart pages of these docs uses it. See the chart engine and performance pages.

## Chart

Support: beta

Cartesian chart drawn on a `<canvas type="2d">` by the DOM-free engine: the web component props mapped to the same presets and engine options, tap / scrub tooltip, legend toggles, pinch zoom, pan and double-tap reset; hover/pointClick/plotClick/zoom events and a template ref handle (resetZoom/getView/setView/getInstance/resize). No WebGPU / WebGL renderer and no keyboard navigation; tooltip.render may only return text. Component tests, H5 tests in happy-dom and the official uni-app WeChat SDK compilation fixture pass. Physical-device E2E and other native targets are not verified.

## ShapeChart

Support: beta

Shape chart drawn on a `<canvas type="2d">` by the DOM-free shape engine: legend toggles (controlled hidden), tap to highlight with the canvas tooltip, animations, hover/click/toggle events and the sunburst drill event; ShapeChart takes the options of any shape type. No keyboard navigation; tooltip.render may only return text. Component tests, H5 tests in happy-dom and the official uni-app WeChat SDK compilation fixture pass. Physical-device E2E and other native targets are not verified.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
