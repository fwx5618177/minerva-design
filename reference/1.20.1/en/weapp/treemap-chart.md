# Treemap

Nested rectangles whose areas are proportional to the values: shows at a glance what takes up the most room in a hierarchy (disk usage, budgets, portfolios). Hover or use the arrow keys to highlight a cell; the tooltip shows its path.

## TreemapChart

Support: beta

Treemap: nested nodes (squarified), parent headers, gap, path in the events. Same as PieChart. Native component tests and package builds pass. Selected selection, disabled-switch, overlay and theme flows were checked in the WeChat Developer Tools simulator, not on a physical device; controlled input remains unverified and automator page RPC timed out. This is not all-API or device E2E validation.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
