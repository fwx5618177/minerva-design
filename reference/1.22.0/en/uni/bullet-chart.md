# Bullet chart

Compact KPI bars (Stephen Few): each row shows a measure as a bar over qualitative ranges (shades of gray, the poorest darkest) with a marker at its target, on the row's own scale. Rows can mix units, so dashboards fit many KPIs in little space. Hover a row or use the arrow keys to read its value, target and range.

## BulletChart

Support: beta

Shape chart drawn on a `<canvas type="2d">` by the DOM-free shape engine: legend toggles (controlled hidden), tap to highlight with the canvas tooltip, animations, hover/click/toggle events; ShapeChart takes the options of any shape type. No keyboard navigation; tooltip.render may only return text. Component tests, H5 tests in happy-dom and the official uni-app WeChat SDK compilation fixture pass. Physical-device E2E and other native targets are not verified.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
