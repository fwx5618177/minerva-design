# Chord diagram

Flows between groups placed around a circle: each group is an arc sized by its flows, each flow a ribbon between two arcs. Undirected, a ribbon joins a pair of groups and is as wide as the flows between them in both directions (a symmetric matrix counts each relation once), so a group that only receives flows keeps its arc; directed, every direction has its own ribbon with an arrowhead. Hover a group to highlight its ribbons, hover a ribbon to read both directions; the legend hides / shows groups and the arrow keys walk through groups then ribbons.

## ChordChart

Support: beta

Chord diagram: group arcs and ribbons from a matrix or links, directed flows with arrows, sorting, ribbon colors, value ticks (configure({ tickFormat })), legend toggles. Same as PieChart. Native component tests and package builds pass. Selected selection, disabled-switch, overlay and theme flows were checked in the WeChat Developer Tools simulator, not on a physical device; controlled input remains unverified and automator page RPC timed out. This is not all-API or device E2E validation.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
