## Documentation

The native Angular package is available. Implemented components and platform differences are listed in the support matrix.

Platform support

### Setup

Install minerva-design and the Angular peer versions declared by the package. Import the shared stylesheet once and bootstrap provideMinerva for theme and locale.

### Signals and native imports

Import standalone directives and components directly. MnButton enhances a native button; MnInput and MnUpload expose typed value models. CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA is not needed.

### Angular Forms

The native input and upload components include ControlValueAccessor support. Use ReactiveFormsModule or FormsModule directly; no custom value-accessor directive is required. Disabled, touched and value updates participate in the Angular form.

Upload selects and validates local files. The application handles network transfers: listen to filesSelected and update each UploadItem status as the transfer progresses.

Every component-page Angular tab runs native standalone Angular components with interactive inputs and outputs. Examples are compiled ahead of time with strict template checks; the displayed source matches the live preview. The separate Web Components guide remains available for custom-element integration.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
