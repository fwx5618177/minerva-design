## ScatterChart

Support: beta

Chart whose untyped series are dots, zooming on both axes. Same as Chart. Native component tests and package builds pass. Selected selection, disabled-switch, overlay and theme flows were checked in the WeChat Developer Tools simulator, not on a physical device; controlled input remains unverified and automator page RPC timed out. This is not all-API or device E2E validation.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
