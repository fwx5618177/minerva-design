# Sankey diagram

Flows between stages: energy balances, user journeys, budget allocations. Nodes sit in columns, the thickness of a link is proportional to its flow, and the node order is relaxed to straighten the flows and avoid crossings. Hover a node to highlight all its flows, or a link to see it as a share of its source; the arrow keys walk through the nodes and links.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.

## Example: Energy flows

From the sources to the uses through the grid; the link thickness is the flow, colored from source to target.

Kind: internal-demo. The files below preserve the documentation example and its local dependencies. Documentation translation/runtime context may still be required; use a standalone recipe for an isolated application.

External dependencies: minerva-design

Documentation context imports: none

Visitors from page to page and the ones who leave; steps aligned left, flows colored like their source.
