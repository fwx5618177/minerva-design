# Bullet chart

Compact KPI bars (Stephen Few): each row shows a measure as a bar over qualitative ranges (shades of gray, the poorest darkest) with a marker at its target, on the row's own scale. Rows can mix units, so dashboards fit many KPIs in little space. Hover a row or use the arrow keys to read its value, target and range.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.

## Example: KPIs against targets

One row per KPI with its value, its target marker and qualitative ranges named in the tooltip.

Kind: internal-demo. The files below preserve the documentation example and its local dependencies. Documentation translation/runtime context may still be required; use a standalone recipe for an isolated application.
