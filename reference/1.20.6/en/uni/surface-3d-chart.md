# 3D surface chart

Surfaces z = f(x, y) over a regular grid: lighting, built-in color maps (viridis, plasma, terrain…), wireframe, contour lines projected on the floor and transparency. Drag to rotate, Ctrl / ⌘ + wheel to zoom.

## Surface3DChart

Support: n/a

Not exported: needs a DOM and WebGPU / WebGL (virtualized DOM panels, GPU rendering), which mini-program views do not provide. Use a web-view page that renders the web component (minerva-design/charts) on mini-programs. Unsupported on this platform.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
