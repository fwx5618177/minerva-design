## TimeAndSales

Support: n/a

Not exported: these components need a DOM and WebGPU / WebGL (virtualized DOM panels, GPU rendering), which mini-program views do not provide. Use a web-view page that renders the web component (minerva-design/charts) on mini-programs. Unsupported on this platform.

## Installation and initialization

See [installation](./setup.md). Styles and root providers belong in the application entry. Renderer support and host testing do not imply native-device certification.
